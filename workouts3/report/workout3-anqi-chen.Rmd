# Report

## Report for this lab is basically doing analyze around two scholars. They are in the economic field and they share some in common. I am going to show their commons and differences.

### 1. Firstly, I am going to show co-authors and to see if they have published papers together.
```{r}
# On average, which scholar has more co-authors?
co_authorA <- unique(unlist(strsplit(as.character(data$authora),split = ",")))
length(co_authorA)-1
co_authorB <- unique(unlist(strsplit(as.character(datb$authorb),split = ",")))
length(co_authorB)-1
# scholar A has 577 co-authors and scholar B has 495 co-authors. Comapring these two scolars, we find that scholar A has more co-authors.

# Did the two scholars once publish a paper together? If yes, please print the related information of that paper.
publish_together <- data$titlea[as.character(data$authora)=="AV Banerjee, E Duflo"]
data.frame(publish_together)
# We can see that two scholars have published papers in common. 

# What’s the paper with the most co-authors?
data$titlea[which.max(nchar(as.character(data$authora)))]
datb$titleb[which.max(nchar(as.character(datb$authorb)))]
# Scholar A nad B has the same the paper with the most co-authors: A multifaceted program causes lasting progress for the very poor: Evidence from six countries. 
```

### 2. In this part, I am going to look more on their citations and years. I am going to analyze their citations information, including where they publish their paper, total numbers of citation for each journal, and then we can leanr that which journla is the most influencial in their academic field.
```{r}
# How many distinct journals are there in the two citation tables?
length(unique(data$journala))
length(unique(datb$journalb))
# There are 368 unique journals in the scholarA and 348 unique journals in the scholarB.

# Count the total number of citations for each journal.
tb1 <- tbl_df(data) %>% group_by(journala) %>% summarize(suma = sum(citationa,na.rm = TRUE))
tb1
tb2 <- tbl_df(datb) %>% group_by(journalb) %>% summarize(sumb = sum(citationb,na.rm = TRUE))
tb2

# From the citations data, which journal do you think is the most influencial in their academic field?
tb1$journala[which.max(tb1$suma)]
tb2$journalb[which.max(tb2$sumb)]

# Accoding too these reult, two sholars share the same journal: The Quarterly journal of economics. Both of the two journlas have the most citiations in this journal.So, this journal is the most influencial in their academic field. 

```

# Graph
## We have wordcloud graphs to how thir mostly used words in their paper titles. 
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('../images/wordcloudA.png')
knitr::include_graphics('../images/wordcloudB.png')
```
