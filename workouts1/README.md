## Assignments

This is the first workout assignment. For this assignmnt, we analyzed fun facts about the storms happened between year 2010-2015. We downloaded data from the webiste and do some analyzes. We will include some overall summary. Also, we will work on detailed datas to provide more information behind these datas. 

We also include some graphs about the storm data. We will look at the overall storms over the word and then more detailed in year and month. These graphs will illustrate more clearly.
